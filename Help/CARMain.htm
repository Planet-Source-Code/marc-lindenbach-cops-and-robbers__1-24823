<FONT color=red size=+3>The Survival Game</FONT><P>
<FONT color=lime>

The Survival game is played by trying to get rid of all the helicopters in the
air, to do this we use guns, nitros, and health (See  
<A href="CARMain.htm#3" title="How To Use The Items">Items</A>). Also every
second you last against the helicopters you gain a point. Once you have destryoed all the
helicopters you will win the game, but if the helciopters destroy you first you
will lose (See  
<A href="CARMain.htm#6" title="How To Kill The Helicopters">Helicopters</A>)<BR>

<FONT color=red size=+3>The Robber Game</FONT><P>
<FONT color=lime>
In the Robber game you are to get to the bank, and then get back to your club
house (See  
<A href="CARMain.htm#4" title="How To Move Around The Game">Terrain</A>) 
without getting killed. Unlike the survival game points are hard to come by,
because you do not get a point every second. Besides that this game is much like
survival execpt that you do not need to kill all the helicopters to win.<BR>

<FONT color=red size=+3>The Terrain</FONT><P>
<FONT color=lime>
In Cops and Robbers there are 3 main different types of terrain they are road,
buildings, and flower gardens, there are also two special ones they are the
clubhouse and the bank (See  
<A href="CARMain.htm#2" title="The Robber Game">Robber Game</A>)
Now below you can see each type of terrain, and what it does:<BR>
Building <IMG SRC="Regular1.bmp"> You cannot go through this type of terrain, but
helicopters can fly over it.<BR>
Flower Gardens <IMG SRC="flower.bmp"> You can go onto this type of terrain, and
helicopters can fly over it.<BR>
Club House <IMG SRC="Club House.bmp"> This is where you start off and where you
bring the money once you have stolen it from the bank.<BR>
Bank <IMG src="Bank.bmp"> This is the object where you steal the money if you
are playing in "Robber" mode.<BR>
The Tunnel <IMG SRC="Tunnel.bmp"> There are two of these on the map, if you go
into them you can end up on the other side of the map (hint: this is good for 
tricking or hearding off the helicopters)<BR>

<FONT color=red size=+3>The Helicopter</FONT><P>
<FONT color=lime>
The helicopters are the enemy in this game. You can blow them up when you get a
gun (See  
<A href="CARMain.htm#3" title="The Items">Items</A>). But the helicopter can
fight back when a helicopter goes over you car it unleasheas a blaze of gunfire.
You can hear this and will also notice your health bar going down very fast, most
likley you want to stay away from senerios like that.<BR>

<FONT color=red size=+3>The Controls</FONT><P>
<FONT color=lime>
The Controls are quite simple for Cops and Robbers. They are the "up button" for 
going up, the "down button" for going down, the "right button" for going right, the 
"left button" for going left, the space bar for nitros, and "d" for the cheat menu(See  
<A href="CARMain.htm#8" title="The Cheats">Cheat Codes</A>). When you have picked up a gun(See  
<A href="CARMain.htm#3" title="The Items">Items</A>) You can click on on of the helicopters
and blow it out of the air, depending on wether you have unlimited helicopters on (See  
<A href="CARMain.htm#5" title="The Options">Options</A>) you may have one less helicopter
left to deal with.<BR>
